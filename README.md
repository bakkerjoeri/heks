# â˜ž Heks Engine

A game development framework in TypeScript.

## Installation
```bash
npm install heks
```

## Usage

Start by creating a new game:

```ts
import { Game, GameEvents, EventEmitter } from 'heks';

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter<GameEvents>();
const game = new Game(
	{ width: 320, height: 180 },
	eventEmitter,
	{ containerSelector: '#game' },
);
```

A game takes an event emitter. You can write your own, or use the one provided by Heks.

You can also optionally provide a selector for the container the game should mount its canvas in, but by default it will put that in the `body`.

Heks has two main concepts: **events** and **entities**.

### Entities

Entities are the game objects, and are described by their components. Through functions like `findEntities`, heks provides you a way to find entities with certain components.

### Events

Events are what makes the Heks game framework tick.

When you start your game by calling `game.start()`, a `start` event is fired. Then, each animation frame, the following events are fired in order:

1. `beforeUpdate`
2. `update`
3. `afterUpdate`
4. `beforeDraw`
5. `draw`
6. `afterDraw`

Each event calls their subscribed handlers with the current state and some event object. Each event handler is expected to return a new state.

Subscribe to an event using `on`:

```ts
eventEmitter.on('draw', renderGame);
```

You can also emit events from within other events:

```ts
import {
    Game,
    Entity,
    getEntities,
    findEntity,
    GameState,
    EventEmitter,
    GameEvents,
    UpdateEvent,
    EventHandlerContext
} from 'heks';

// Make sure you declare any event types not already in GameEvents.
interface MyGameEvents extends GameEvents {
    jump: { entity: Entity, time: number }
}

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter<MyGameEvents>();

const game = new Game(
	{ width: 320, height: 180 },
	eventEmitter,
);

const processPlayerState = (
    state: GameState,
    { time }: UpdateEvent,
    { emit }: EventHandlerContext<MyGameEvents>
): GameState => {
    const playerEntity = findEntity(getEntities(state), { isPlayer: true });

    if (!playerEntity) {
        return state;
    }

    if (playerEntity.state === 'jump') {
        return emit('jump', state, { entity: playerEntity, time, });
    }

    return state;
}

eventEmitter.on('update', processPlayerState);
```
